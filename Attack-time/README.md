# Attack time

- 5:00 – 7:00

Users log in to the system, triggering both automated and manual processes, resulting in entries in event logs.

- 11:00 – 13:00

Most users take a lunch break, either manually logging out or being logged out automatically due to inactivity. During this time, anomalies may occur due to personal online activities, such as checking the news or shopping.

- 17:00 – 19:00

As the workday ends, users save their files, sometimes hastily making mistakes, such as opening malicious attachments. Many leave their accounts open or do not properly log out.

- 21:00 – 23:00

After work, users are less concerned with the security of their accounts. Shift changes during the night create windows of opportunity for attacks, as vulnerable periods may occur between shifts.

- 23:00 – 1:00

Backups and other scheduled maintenance tasks take place, which may cause activity in monitoring systems. SOC personnel may work on other tasks during this time.

- 3:00 – 5:00

This time is used for batch tasks like log processing or system checks. Most users are asleep, and their accounts remain inactive.
